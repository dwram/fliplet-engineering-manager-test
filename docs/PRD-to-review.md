# PRD Review Task

## üìù Instructions
Review the following PRD and identify **3 critical issues**.

## Example PRD
### Feature: User Profile Management
1. Users should be able to update their name and email.
2. There is no authentication mechanism specified.
3. No mention of error handling.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Your Review
- Issue 1: The PRD is listing issues and problems as features, creating ambiguity as to what needs to be built. Ideally, the PRD is listing requirements/outcomes and highlighting user journeys, paving the way for Engineers to arrive at outputs to enable them.
- Issue 2: The PRD is missing essential requirements for profile management. There are additional fields, validation rules, behaviours, access controls, data privacy requirements and how changes to a user profile can impact other system components that typically constitute a PRD and User Profile management.
- Issue 3: No success / acceptance criteria. Thus, the PRD fails to communicate a qualitative/quantitative measure for a successfully implemented feature, making independent QA, sign-off and Go-Live difficult, if not impossible.
