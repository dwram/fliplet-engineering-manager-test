# Scalability Plan for Image Processing
## Challenge
Handling 10M+ images per day.
This translates to 10M/24 = ~420K+/hour 
~420K/60 = ~7K/minute
~120/second 

@1MB per picture = 60MB/second

No burst capacity needed

## Solution
### Core Processing Architecture
#### Upload Flow
Users upload images to S3 directly with presigned URLs. This keeps our app servers free from handling binary data. For mobile uploads, we'll use CloudFront to accelerate connections from spotty networks.
Processing Pipeline
Once images land in S3, we'll:

1. Trigger an event notification
2. Drop that into an SQS queue 
3. Have Lambda functions pull from the queue

Each Lambda will:

- Validate the image (format, size, content)
- Extract any metadata we need
- Generate multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, large)
- Optimize for web (convert to WebP where supported)
- Store processed versions back to S3

For complex workflows, like if we need approvals or multiple processing stages, we can add Step Functions to coordinate.

#### Delivery Strategy
This is critical for those weak mobile connections:

1. Store processed images in a delivery S3 bucket
2. Put CloudFront in front with aggressive caching
3. Implement adaptive serving based on client capabilities
4. Use progressive JPEGs so something displays quickly

### Further Enhancements

#### DynamoDB
Instead of trying to query S3 for metadata, we'll store all custom attributes and tags.

I'm thinking a single table design with GSIs for the most common query patterns.

#### ElastiCache (Redis)
Cache hot images to reduce S3 egress costs

#### AWS Batch for Heavy Processing
When we need to do video processing or intensive operations beyond Lambda's limits:

1. Configure to use Spot Instances for up to 90% savings
2. Set up right-sized compute environments
3. Reserve for predictable baseline, use on-demand for spikes


#### CloudWatch with X-Ray
Enterprise monitoring is a must:

1. Trace requests end-to-end across services
2. Set up anomaly detection for cost spikes
3. Configure intelligent alerting

### Cost Optimization Strategies
Beyond the services themselves, we'll implement these techniques:

- Lambda Power Tuning - We'll run this tool to find the optimal memory/cost configuration
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering - For images with unpredictable access patterns
- Lifecycle Policies - Move rarely accessed images to Glacier after 90 days
- Compute Savings Plans - Commit to a baseline for 17% savings on Lambda
- CloudFront Price Class Selection - Choose distribution based on where our users actually are
- AWS Budgets - Set up proactive notifications for cost trends
- Spot Instances - Use for AWS Batch processing jobs

### Implementation Timeline

Week 1-2: Set up basic pipeline (S3 (input sink) → SQS (FIFO) → Lambda → S3 (output sink))
Week 3-4: Add DynamoDB, Rekognition, and mobile optimization
Week 5: Implement CloudFront with proper caching
Week 6: Add ElastiCache and EventBridge integration
Week 7-8: Set up CloudWatch monitoring and cost optimization
Week 9-10: Performance testing and tuning
